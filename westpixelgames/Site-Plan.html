    <p>Welcome to West Pixel Games! We are a small indie game development company who specializes in small shooting games.

      About our team:
        We are a small 1 man team with high goals and aspirations. We are currently working on one 3d space game and one 2d game that is currently in development.
      
      We use both Unity, Blender and Gimp to help design and make our games. We design games that are simple and easy to play. These games have smooth controls and easy to control.

      <p>	Unity: Unity is a game engine that we use to design our games. It is simple and easy to use. We use C# to code our games and program the back end.
        Gimp: Gimp is a drawing app similar to Adobe photoshop. We use this to draw prototype images for our games as well as concept art. We also use this for out game design for smaller 2d projects
          Blender: Blender is a 3d object designer app. We use this to design simple 3d objects for our more complex games. This is a more complex program that is rather difficult to use.
